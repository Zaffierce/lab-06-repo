Enjoy talks about the most innovative subjects in: AI, ML, voice platforms, the Cloud and search. One of the objectives of Dynamic Talks is to foster and encourage the local technology community to share knowledge. Every event is free, with complimentary food and drinks.\nTopic: \"ML and Predictive Analytics in the Modern Enterprise\"\nAgenda\n[5:30pm - 6:00pm]: Guests arrive, food and drinks are served\n[6:00pm - 6:30pm]: The first talk will be presented by Eugene Steinberg on “Not Your Father's Search Engine: Deep learning applications for e-commerce search”, followed by a Q&A\n[6:30pm - 7:00pm]: The second talk will be presented by Shervin Majd on \"Reducing No-shows and Late Cancelations in Healthcare Enterprise\", followed by a Q&A\n[7:00pm - 7:20pm]: Networking break\n[7:20pm - 7:50pm]: The third talk will be presented by Rumi Olsen on \" Deep learning with AWS\", followed by QA\n[7:50pm - 8:20pm]: The fouth talk will be presented by Parag Shrivastava on \"Implementing AI for New Business Models and Efficiencies\", followed by QA\n[8:20pm - 8:30pm]: More networking, closing remarks, and the event concludes\nTalk Details\nEugene Steinberg's talk details:\nTitle: \"Not Your Father's Search Engine: Deep Learning Applications for e-Commerce Search\"\nAbstract: In this talk, we will discuss how recent advancements in artificial intelligence are transforming traditional search technologies. Deep learning-based image analysis and natural language processing open exciting new horizons for search and recommendation applications across the industries. We’ll talk about how deep learning models can help conventional search engines to achieve better relevance. We will share our experience implementing innovative solutions for online retailers, finance and high tech customers.\nAbout Eugene Steinberg:\nEugene Steinberg is a Technical Fellow and founding engineer at Grid Dynamics. As a Principal Architect and Consultant, Eugene has delivered some of the largest Grid Dynamics programs, from inception to production to maturing. He has many interests, including: information retrieval, e-commerce and enterprise search, natural language processing, computer vision, general science, and the art of building scalable distributed systems. Eugene earned a PhD in Applied Math from Saratov State University.\nShervin Majd's talk details:\nTitle: \"Reducing No-shows and Late Cancelations in Healthcare Enterprise\"\nAbstract: Patient No-shows and Late Cancelations is estimated to cost around $150B across the nation. Providence St. Joseph Health, Healthcare Intelligence Group has been working on this pain point for the past couple of years and has developed a software solution leveraging a predictive engine to identify high risk patients at risk of No-show and Late Cancellation on a daily basis. More than 25 clinics have been using this solution for about 2 years now to optimize their reminder call strategy and to have a meaningful reduction of No-shows and Late Cancellations. In addition, a call center pilot was designed recently to standardize this process end-end. Pilot results will be evaluated to prove the impact at scale.\nAbout Shervin Majd:\nShervin Majd is a Digital Health executive with more than ten years hands-on product and strategy leadership experience collaborating with multidisciplinary teams to develop and launch innovative solutions across the care continuum. Currently, Shervin is an executive member of Providence health and St. Joseph and responsible for development of innovative web/mobile digital health applications and platforms, leveraging near real-time access to data, advanced analytics and predictive data models.Prior to that, he was director of mobile health programs at Nantmobile and a member of the executive team where he was responsible for building digital health and wellness products to empower patients and clinicians. Shervin also worked at Vodafone ventures and was responsible for incubation, domestic and global product launches, as well as strategic investments in mobile health domain.

This is in action in pharmaceutical supply chain for reducing costs, increasing volumes, and optimizing the contracts with suppliers. The implementation involves process and tools that make data usable, and overcome the challenges of culture, ethics, data scalability, compute and engineering, and. Learn about data collection, data management, and metadata management tools implementation and modern data architecture to support them. Discuss machine learning algorithms for growth and efficiency scenarios.\nAbout Parag Shrivastava:\nParag is a data architecture and products leader at McKesson, and leads the strategy, implementation, and management of enterprise data. He has led multiple initiatives at McKesson including data analytics for Joint Venture between McKesson and Walmart, wherein the partnership resulted in joint sourcing of Generics Pharmaceutical. He also led Synergy analytics for McKesson’s $8B acquisition in Europe. Prior to McKesson, Parag was a Technology Consulting Manager at Deloitte, primarily focused on data and technology strategy and transformation at large Healthcare provider, payor, and medical device companies, scoping, planning, and implementing the clinical information systems, insurance claims platform stabilization, and business intelligence.\nAbout Rumi Olsen:\nRumi Olsen is a seasoned computer scientist with over a decade of engineering experience. As a Partner Solutions Architect at AWS, she solves day-to-day challenges for cloud builders globally. Rumi has expertise in AWS serverless application development as well as AWS machine learning services.\nParking Information:\nThere are two nearby garages, directly underneath the building and right across the street.

We will be writing letters and emails to City of Seattle leadership, urging them to:\n\n\nmove forward with studying green spaces and transit-oriented design near future Link light-rail stations, with a focus on equity, social justice, and climate change; and\n\n\nadvance the principles and policies of 350 Seattle's Green New Deal and the MASS Coalition's Transportation Package.\n\n\nOur Monthly Volunteer Event is a great way to get involved with The Urbanist! If you're interested in learning more about us, having an impact in the community, and getting to know other urbanists, then this is a great opportunity. Each event consists of two tasks. The first is providing support to our featured ally organization, and the second task is an Urbanist project. We will provide all materials. Please arrive prepared to help out, make friends, and get a coffee or beer (to support our host venue!). We'll be meeting on August 21 at Cafe Solstice. The venue is accessible, with step free access to the main floor. Look for us at the long table in the back of the cafe.\nOur August partner is the Capitol Hill Renter Initiative (CHRI). CHRI brings together renters to advocate for affordability, social justice, and community in Capitol Hill and throughout Seattle. We provide space, support, and expertise for tenant-focused civic engagement via education and outreach on issues affecting renters. At our monthly meetings, which are open to the public, we've hosted guest speakers ranging from city planners to tenant organizers to Capitol Hill artists and musicians. We've also organized movie nights, picnics in Cal Anderson Park, and other social gatherings. We envision a Capitol Hill neighborhood with diverse people and housing types; a welcoming, walkable, multimodal, equitable, accessible, and affordable community for all residents.",

These solutions will help mitigate stormwater runoff, conserve of our City's potable water supply, and improve the performance of our buildings. Come engage with the winning design team, who transformed the roof of the Expeditors Headquarters in downtown Seattle into a water recycling project, keeping over 400,000 gallons of stormwater out of our sewers and reducing their demand on municipal supply. There will also be the opportunity to connect with our amazing judges who represent some of the leading sustainability firms in our region. We will also be discussing how these solutions can be replicated throughout Seattle and the pressing need to retrofit Seattle's downtown core to help protect Puget Sound. Come learn how we can transform our buildings to act as trees and help Seattle operate as its natural ecosystem.\nDrinks and snacks will be provided. \nReach out to stevenfry@2030districts.org with any questions.\n",
